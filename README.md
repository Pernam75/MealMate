## 🧐 Features <a name = "features"></a>
* Find the recipes that match you the most with our recommendation engine
* See the recipe steps and the ingredients you need
* Add your favorite recipe to your list
* Filter the recipe by tags, nutrional facts or specific diet you have

## 🚀 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Open the project in Visual Studio Code and run

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
expo start
```

Then scan the QR Code with your phone in order to run the app in Expo App

You can read here the full [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)

## 🛠️ Dependencies <a name = "dependencies"></a>

You can test the Python code without running the app by runing [script.py](https://github.com/Pernam75/MealMate/blob/main/python-scripts/script.py) or [API.ipynb](https://github.com/Pernam75/MealMate/blob/main/python-scripts/API.ipynb) files.

The libraries we used are available with pip installator

For the API running the Python code :

```bash
pip install flask
```

For machine learning datas' manipulations :

```bash
pip install numpy
```

```bash
pip install pandas
```
 
For machine-learning recommendation with KNN algorithm :

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

```bash
pip install scipy
```

For web scraping BeautifulSoup HTML parser (not used in the final code but has built the json files) :

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
