bring 2 cups of veggie broth ( can use bouillon and water) per 1 cup bulgur

when broth is boiling stir in bulgur. cover and simmer about 15 minutes or until bulgur is soft. all the broth should be absorbed. fluff the bulgur with a fork as you would rice and add to your recipe.

so many people have asked me how long to cook tenderloins if they have ""more than one"" to cook, i wanted to give a simple response.  answer:  so long as the tenderloins are not touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  example:  if cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes total.   this makes it a great entree recipe when having a dinner party for 8-12 people, or more.

to clarify the directions since one reviewer mentioned that they had a problem with their first batch: make sure that your machine's dough cycle includes the rising time!  i thought everyone's did, but apparently not.  (my own personal machine mixes up the ingredients and then there's a total rise time of a little over an hour (closer to 1.5 hours).  so, if you think your abm just mixes things up but doesn't allow for rising time, add a 2 hour (approx) rise time between steps 1 and 2.  if your machine's dough cycle does have a built in rising time, then you're all set, and you can follow the instructions exactly, no need for extra rising time.

tips for chips: i notice one reviewer had difficulty with the chips. here are a few tips or tricks for chips: make sure they are dried thoroughly. make sure the fat is very hot - 190 degrees c. certain potatoes are better for chipping, such as king edwards, desiree, majestic, maris piper, and romano. you can soak the chips for an hour before the first frying - it extracts excess starch, which helps in the ""crisping"" process! always drain them thoroughly before serving. i hope these tips will help!","['cod fish fillets', 'plain flour', 'bicarbonate of soda', 'beer', 'lemon, juice of', 'salt & pepper', 'flour', 'potatoes', 'cooking fat']",9,633.3,3.0,11.0,19.0,105.0,2.0,31.0

important:  take your roast out of the fridge, and let it set to get it to room temperature before baking!

if you like really rare bake for 15 mins. at 500.  

if you like your roast beef cooked med-rare, put in for 18 mins. at 500.

if you like it well done, then just burn the darn thing lol.

what's nice about this roast is, if someone likes it done a little more, please keep in mind that the end pieces will be done a little more.


***(the roast in the series of photos that i took was a 2.75 lb. bottom of the round roast.  i baked it at 500 for 15 mins., then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for 1 hour for a rare roast.)

seasonings to detract from the traditional southern flavor, or gunked up with cheese to turn it into a gratin or doria. we enjoy this authentic southern dish year-round, so good in its creamy simplicity and subtle flavors.  my family always expects it for christmas dinner alongside the ham and cranberry chutney. be your own judge regarding measurements. i learned from my grandmother and she never measured, so i've learned to guestimate on many of my recipes.

note: this dish can easily be frozen after baking, then thawed out and reheated.  i do not recommend freezing without baking first, since potatoes will sometimes get mushy if frozen uncooked.  i personally do not like a tin baking pan for this particular recipe, especially for freezing, since it can sometimes impart a ""tinny"" taste. also, if this recipe is baked in a glass baking dish and then frozen, the glass will shatter if not at room temperature.  so, if  freezing in a glass baking dish, i recommend baking and freezing in corning ware since it will not break.","['idaho potatoes', 'onions', 'butter', 'flour', 'milk', 'salt and pepper']",6,226.4,10.0,12.0,3.0,11.0,20.0,12.0

by the summer of 1924, the clockmaker’s caramel coated popcorn had captivated the entire city’s attention; everyone was frantically lining up at his busy stand to buy the sweet, sticky confection. a few months later, just as the clockmaker was preparing to close his stand for the day, a small fire ignited near the stove. the clockmaker instinctively ran out to call for help. when he returned, just seconds later, he remembered leaving the framed recipe hanging on the wall. the clockmaker quickly ran into the burning stand to retrieve the recipe, but he never made it out.

when the fire inspectors went into the charred ruins to investigate the accident, they found the clockmaker’s frame lying in a pile of smoking debris. the frame was in pristine condition; not a dent, nor a blemish, could be seen on it. however, the recipe was gone.  

the recipe for the clockmaker’s caramel popcorn recently surfaced and is beginning to circulate around the globe. unfortunately, many people think the recipe is haunted because it is believed that if your clock stops running after making the recipe it’s because the clockmaker has paid you a visit in hopes of reclaiming his long, lost recipe.

note:  this recipe, as written, results in a sticky, chewy caramel popcorn.  if you prefer a crunchier caramel popcorn, bake it in the oven at 250 degrees for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.","['margarine', 'brown sugar', 'karo syrup', 'salt', 'baking soda', 'vanilla', 'popped popcorn']",7,810.4,36.0,468.0,49.0,5.0,24.0,51.0

i have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the ""traditional"" recipe, all make a difference in the end result. 

i have also found that land o' lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. don't let the butter sit out too long. it needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. if that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. it also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. it helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. 

another thing i've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. when i moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. i finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when i switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!","['all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'real butter', 'shortening', 'brown sugar', 'vanilla', 'eggs', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips', 'nuts']",10,164.3,13.0,56.0,4.0,3.0,20.0,7.0

also, i do use cupcake liners because i think they present better.
lastly, it's best to prepare mascarpone filling & chill about 4-6 hours in advance or night before.
fyi:  you can fill the cupcakes by using a icing decorating (piping) bag filled with the mascarpone filling or use an old fashioned ketchup or mustard plastic bottle with nozzle point tip << yes, those ugly yellow & red things :-)
*** update:  some of you contacted me about skipping the pastry bag step, that's completely fine, what you need to do is leave room when filling cupcake wrappers by not filling all the way, after cupcakes are baked, you poke the holes & do the liquid coffee over top of poked cakes, then just top with the mascarpone layer (make sure it's chilled well as it thickens) then just use the cream cheese frosting on top of that & top with chocolate shavings.","['white cake mix', 'eggs', 'oil', 'water', ""confectioners' sugar"", 'instant coffee', 'mascarpone cheese', 'kahlua', 'sweetened condensed milk', 'french vanilla cool whip', 'cream cheese', 'butter', 'vanilla extract', 'chocolate shavings']",14,261.4,20.0,108.0,9.0,5.0,26.0,10.0
